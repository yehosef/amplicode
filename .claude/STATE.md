### âœ… Key Architectural Decisions Made

**Performance:**
- Bash hooks (NOT Python) â†’ 15-30x faster
- Target: <50ms per hook call
- Background worker doesn't block Claude Code

**Data Safety:**
- Global single worker (NOT per-project)
- File locking with fcntl
- Atomic writes (tmp â†’ rename)
- Multi-session safe

**Learning Strategy:**
- Focus on "correction pattern" (highest value)
- 3-level hierarchy (global/language/project)
- Auto-promotion when patterns emerge
- User transparency and control

**Distribution:**
- Claude Code plugin (easy installation)
- Auto-configured hooks
- Slash commands for control
- Team sharing via repository-level plugin

## What's NOT Built Yet (The Work Ahead)

### ðŸš§ Phase 1: Core Plugin Infrastructure

**Files to create:**
```
plugin/
â”œâ”€â”€ plugin.json                    # Plugin manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      # Plugin-specific docs
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks.json                 # Hook registration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stop_hook.sh               # Detect corrections
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sessionend_hook.sh         # Queue session summary

â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ learning_worker.py         # Main worker loop

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ensure_worker.sh           # Worker lifecycle
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â”œâ”€â”€ test_hook_performance.sh   # Verify <50ms
    â”œâ”€â”€ test_macos_setup.sh        # Prerequisites check
    â”œâ”€â”€ test_multi_session.sh      # Data safety
    â””â”€â”€ test_sandbox.sh            # Sandbox compat
```

**Estimated: ~1000 lines of code total**

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Learning Intelligence

**Scope detection:**
- When is preference global vs language vs project?
- LLM prompt design for classification
- Confidence scoring

**Auto-promotion:**
- Detect patterns across projects
- Promote to higher level when appropriate
- Deduplicate after promotion

**Conflict handling:**
- Detect conflicting preferences
- Keep project-specific when conflicts exist
- User notification

### ðŸš§ Phase 3: User Experience

**Slash commands:**
- /amplicode-status â†’ worker health
- /amplicode-logs â†’ view worker logs
- /amplicode-restart â†’ restart worker
- /amplicode-preferences â†’ view all learned
- /amplicode-edit-preference â†’ modify/delete
- /amplicode-learn â†’ explicit teaching

**Transparency:**
- Show why preference was applied
- Show confidence levels
- Show learning history

## Recommendations

### Start Simple, Iterate Fast

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Project-only learning (no global/language yet)
- Basic correction detection (keyword matching)
- Manual worker start (no auto-start in SessionStart yet)
- Simple memory.json schema

**Why:** Validates core loop works before adding complexity

**Phase 2 (Enhanced):**
- Add global preferences
- Add LLM-powered extraction
- Add auto-start in SessionStart
- Add slash commands

**Phase 3 (Full Vision):**
- Add language/platform context
- Add auto-promotion
- Add conflict detection
- Full user control

### Parallel Work Streams

**Can be done in parallel:**
1. Hooks implementation (bash scripting)
2. Worker implementation (Python)
3. Slash commands (markdown)
4. Test scripts (bash)

**Use agents for:**
- Implementing different hooks simultaneously
- Writing test scripts while building core
- Creating documentation while coding

### Quality Gates

**Before each merge:**
- [ ] Hook performance <50ms (measured)
- [ ] No data corruption in multi-session test
- [ ] Worker self-watchdog works (tested with stuck worker)
- [ ] All tests pass

### Risk Mitigation

**Biggest risks:**
1. **Hook performance** â†’ Benchmark early, optimize if needed
2. **Data corruption** â†’ Test multi-session scenario immediately
3. **Worker reliability** â†’ Self-watchdog + heartbeat + recovery
4. **LLM extraction quality** â†’ Start simple, iterate prompts

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success
- Plugin installs successfully
- Hooks fire and queue events
- Worker processes queue
- No crashes in 100-event session

### Week 2 Success
- Can detect a correction
- Can extract a preference
- Can write to memory.json
- Can load preferences on next session

### Week 3 Success
- User corrects something once
- Next session, Claude respects preference
- User can view learned preferences
- User can delete incorrect preferences

### Final Success
- User stops repeating themselves across sessions
- System learns context (project vs global)
- No performance degradation in Claude Code
- User trusts and relies on the system

## The Moonshot Vision

**Build the entire plugin in one intense push:**
- All hooks implemented
- Worker with self-watchdog
- LLM extraction working
- Memory management solid
- Slash commands functional
- Tests passing
- Ready for real usage

**Use parallel agents to:**
- Implement multiple components simultaneously
- Write tests while building
- Create docs while coding
- Maximize velocity

**Time estimate:** 1 week of intense work (if parallelized well)

**This is achievable because:**
- Architecture is complete
- Decisions are made
- Total code is ~1000 lines
- Components are modular
- Can use agents for parallelism

---

## Next Command

```bash
git checkout -b moonshot
```

**Then:** Build everything. Use agents. Go fast. Ship it.

**Remember:**
- Ruthless simplicity (150-line modules)
- No stubs or placeholders (everything works)
- Analysis-first (think before coding)
- Modular bricks (AI can regenerate)

**You can do this. The architecture is solid. The path is clear. Execute.**
