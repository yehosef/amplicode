# Amplicode - Project Vision

## Inspiration

Based on [Microsoft Amplifier](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier), which provides a framework for building AI-powered development tools.

## Goals

Create an extensible platform using Claude's ecosystem:
- **Plugins**: Modular functionality that extends Claude Code capabilities
- **Agents**: Specialized AI workers for autonomous task execution
- **Skills**: Reusable capability packages for common workflows

## Architecture Decisions Needed

### 1. Language Selection
- TypeScript/Node.js (better for Claude SDK integration)
- Python (better for AI/ML tooling ecosystem)
- Hybrid approach (core in one language, plugins in both)

### 2. Plugin System Design
- How plugins are discovered and loaded
- Plugin API surface and contracts
- Security and sandboxing considerations

### 3. Agent Framework
- Agent definition format (YAML, JSON, code-based?)
- Task routing and orchestration
- State management and persistence
- Communication between agents

### 4. Skill System
- Skill packaging format
- Distribution mechanism (npm, pip, custom registry?)
- Skill composition and reusability
- Versioning strategy

## Next Steps

1. Review Microsoft Amplifier architecture in detail
2. Examine Claude Code plugin/agent/skill documentation
3. Define MVP feature set
4. Create initial project structure
5. Implement proof-of-concept for one component

## Resources to Review

- Microsoft Amplifier repository and documentation
- Claude Code plugin development guides
- Claude API documentation for agent patterns
- Existing Claude skills examples
